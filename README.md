# Daniel's Computer Shack

Here you may find the "source" of my blog, [Daniel's Computer Shack](https://ficd.ca/). You may notice this is not a traditional Neocities website; instead, it is a collection of markdown files which are converted into HTML and deployed automatically to Neocities whenever I push to this repository. I will provide more detailed instructions on how you can set this sort of thing up for yourself at a later time.

As it stands, I am using a tool called `zoner` to handle building the website, and a GitHub workflow to automate the process of building and deploying. I'm not a fan of relying on this binary, however. On one hand it's quite large, possibly a result of it being written in C#. Its developer also no longer actively maintains it. The project is open source, however, so I am considering forking the project and porting it to another language. This would also allow me to implement new features.
