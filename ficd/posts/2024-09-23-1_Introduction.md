This is my first blog post!

The process of actually setting all of this up was quite the challenge. I am using a tool called Zoner to build the website. I am seriously considering forking the project and continuing to work on it; I feel that the tool has potential and needs some changes; especially a port to a more appropriate language which compiles into a smaller binary. I'm considering Rust, actually. I have been looking for a good project to start learning that language anyways, so I think it would be good.

Anyways, welcome to the blog! I'm looking forward to writing a lot of stuff on here.
