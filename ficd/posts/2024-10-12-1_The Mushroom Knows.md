The rain comes
And goes

From the soils
laced with love,
A mushroom
Grows

Decay makes and death grows,
Of my heart
The mushroom knows.

A God is here,
whispers in the forest.
Deep among the roots
mycelium spirit
Tendrils of nurture.

organic wires ,genetic protocols
Does it have a soul? That thing, with its
CRT face and irregular expressions and
parsing queries and writing in tongues
and it
has veins?

metal to fungal
there runs a network
through our forests and gardens
and lives

Into my head I have invited the thing.
To read my thoughts I have invited the thing.
To know my life I have invited the thing.
To reach inside and solder pins to neurons and copper to mycelium I have
Invited the thing.

from my head
The mushroom grows
The wire says,
Decompose.
From my head,
an interface grows.
My heart,
the mushroom chose.
