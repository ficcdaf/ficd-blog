## [This place is a prison](https://thepostalservice.bandcamp.com/track/this-place-is-a-prison)

The web we know is spun by gluttonous spiders no longer satiated by flies and roaches. They cast their net wide across the world, like cuckoos they lay their parasitic eggs inside our lives. They fondle our brains until our DNA is infested with algorithms, our ribcages become datacenters and our eyes turn into screens.

No more.

The spores are already sprouting, recycling the decaying corpse of the corporate internet into binary compost. My only goal is to help you feed the fungi, should you wish.

Welcome to the small web.

## The Lovecraftian Internet

The internet is incomprehensively massive. As of publication, conservative estimates claim at least **4.2 billion** indexed webpages.<sup>1</sup> _Indexed_, in this context, means publicly accessible individual webpages that can be found on a search engine because [web crawlers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler) can reach them. This is known as the **surface web**.

The figure does _not_ account for the _rest_ of the internet: private resources hidden behind firewalls, internal webpages and services, e-mail traffic, IoT devices, direct messages, video game servers, media & file storage, just to name a few.

Evidence.

The web is a Lovecraftian entity (reference lovecraft's spider story lol)

Close: This story does not involve an itsy-bitsy spider.
